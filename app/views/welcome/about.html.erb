      <p>Everyone on the network was selected because they have a great story to share, they have expertise in one or several categories of Finance, and they want to speak with you about your career. Each professional has volunteered their time and energy and is supporting their industry, community, and charity of choice. A portion of all fees represents a donation to that charity on behalf of the Finance professional.</p>
      <p>The more time you spend researching and speaking with professionals in your chosen field, the better chance you will have in uncovering an amazing career opportunity. You will save time and frustration by avoiding areas of Finance that donâ€™t match your skill set or interest you and you will greatly increase your chances of being selected during the interview process. Knowledge about the role and industry you are entering is a very powerful resource.This is not an opportunity to ask for a job. This is an opportunity to network with working professionals to find out more about the people and opportunities in different areas of finance. Please respect the privacy and time of the busy professionals in the Network.</p>
      <p>We have represented the Finance Industry in this format knowing that job titles, roles, and locations are subject to change and do not represent every option within Finance. Some companies have different titles and structures and may not match this exact configuration. Do not let that stop you from seeking information from our Network. If there is a specific role or area you would like to explore and we do not have anyone in the Network, please contact us and we will find you a connection.</p>
