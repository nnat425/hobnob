<p> Hi <%= @advisor.firstname %>,</p>

<p>Thank you for volunteering to be a part of the Hob Nob Professional Network! We are starting Hob Nob with 100 carefully selected and exclusive professionals. You represent many different areas of expertise in Finance as well as years of experience, location, and a variety of companies. Our current Network is Toronto centric with some individuals that have moved from the Toronto area, and as the business grows, we will be adding more professionals from financial centres across the globe. As a professional on the Network, you are creating an instant global network for your own career and a portion of every connection fee will be donated to a Charity of your choice.</p>



<p> Please complete your full profile with picture and add your calendar availability starting Monday, February 1st, 2016. That is our go live date for students and other professionals that will be interested in speaking with you. You can add as many 30 minute sessions as you like and we are requesting a minimum of 4 – 30 minute sessions. Please select 4 dates and times – each time should be 30 minutes in duration. You are not restricted to dates and times during the day or work week, please select Sunday at midnight if that is a good time for you to spend 30 minutes on the phone. People choosing to speak with you will need to accommodate your busy schedule.</p>



<p> Please ensure that all dates and times are blocked in your calendar as people using the site will be expecting to speak with you on that date and time. We are committed to protecting your privacy and there will be no exchange of personal contact information. Several advance e-mails and reminders as well as a call in number will be provided by Hob Nob once the person connecting has secured a confirmation. </p>



<p> We respect and appreciate your time and know that there are always business related issues that might arise and we are ready to accommodate. Please make changes as you know you are unavailable or provide us with as much notice as possible. </p>



<p> We created a new profile format that should be quick and easy for you. If you have questions or need assistance in finishing this profile, please don’t hesitate to contact Karen. </p>
